The plush is incredibly soft and my daughter carries it everywhere with her. However, I did notice that one of the ears is slightly lower than the other, which seems unintentional. Despite this minor flaw, I found the size to be a bit smaller than expected given the price. I believe there are larger options available for the same cost. On a positive note, the delivery was prompt, arriving a day earlier than anticipated, allowing me to enjoy playing with it before gifting it to my daughter. This plush toy is a charming addition to any collection, perfect for panda enthusiasts of all ages."
